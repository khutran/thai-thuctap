This lightweight plugin lets you easily display related posts in a sidebar or after your posts as thumbnails, links, excerpts or full posts.

== Description ==

Quickly increase your readers' engagement by adding related posts in the sidebar or after post content with a widget or shortcode. Posts with the **most terms in common** will display at the top. This plugin is capable of finding related posts in multiple **taxonomies** and **post types**. Include or exclude terms from the search for related posts. Change the look and feel by using your own templates in your (child) theme.

See the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/related-posts-by-taxonomy/faq/) to have related posts automatically display after the post content without using the shortcode or widget. 

Default usage for the shortcode is:
<pre><code>[related_posts_by_tax]</code></pre>

Attributes for the shortcode are:

* post_id
* taxonomies
* post_types
* posts_per_page
* order
* orderby
* before_shortcode
* after_shortcode
* title
* before_title
* after_title
* exclude_terms
* include_terms
* exclude_posts
* format
* image_size
* columns
* caption
* limit_posts
* limit_year
* limit_month
* related

Example to show 10 related posts instead of the default 5.
<pre><code>[related_posts_by_tax posts_per_page="10"]</code></pre>

See the [documentation](http://keesiemeijer.wordpress.com/related-posts-by-taxonomy/) for more information about the attributes and their defaults.
